# Blackjack - Haskell  

This repository contains the implementation of three projects developed for the **Principles of Programming** (Functional Programming) course using **Haskell**. Each project explores different fundamental concepts of the language, from basic syntax (Projeto 1) to building an interactive application (Projeto 3).  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  
- **`Projeto1/`** - Implementation of operations with a deck of cards and calculations related to Blackjack and Poker. The focus was on developing familiarity with Haskell syntax, list comprehensions, and simple function definitions.  
- **`Projeto2/`** - Modeling of the **Blackjack** game between a player and the house, using recursion, higher-order functions, modules, and type classes. Includes simulation of different playing strategies.  
- **`Projeto3/`** - Development of an interactive **Blackjack** application, supporting file input/output, random deck generation, and automated testing using QuickCheck.  

- Used **QuickCheck** for automated testing
